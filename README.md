# moneyTracker
Tracks peoples expenses, categorizes them, and shows it to them visually

Idea:
1) People can fill out a form
a) The date will be autofilled in form of MM/DD/YYYY
b) The user will put a total of how much they spent
c) The user will put a category for what they spent on
d) The user will have an optional description so they can look at what they spent their $ on 

2) It adds the information they filled to a database

3) The database is dynamic, and it shows the users' data visually back to them or they can look back on all of their expenses
